# LightningRouter â€” Use iPhone Internet on Your Mac Efficiently

A small utility that routes a Mac's network traffic over an iPhone connected via Lightning cable. Use your iPhone's mobile data when Wiâ€‘Fi is slow or unavailable. LightningRouter creates a routed network interface and manages DNS and NAT so your Mac uses the iPhone link with no extra hardware.

Getting the release
- Visit the Releases page and download the installer package for your macOS version: https://github.com/TockToro/LightningRouter/releases
- The file in the release must be downloaded and executed. Look for a .dmg, .pkg, or a signed installer bundle. Run the installer from Finder and follow onâ€‘screen prompts.

Why use LightningRouter? ðŸš€
- Avoid configuring complex proxies.
- Avoid carrier or router changes.
- Maintain full IPv4/IPv6 routing and DNS while on mobile data.
- Use a wired connection to preserve battery on your MacBook and keep wireless radios off.

How it works (brief, plain)
- The macOS system sees the iPhone as a network interface when tethered over Lightning.
- LightningRouter installs a small routing helper and a user agent.
- The helper sets up a dedicated network service on the Mac and binds a NAT rule to the iPhone interface.
- The app adds DNS forwarding rules so name lookups go through the phone link.
- The GUI provides a toggle. The CLI exposes install, enable, disable, and uninstall commands.

Requirements
- Mac with Thunderbolt/Lightning or USB-C + Lightning cable
- macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later
- iPhone with Personal Hotspot enabled
- Local admin privileges to install and apply system network changes

Quick checklist before install
- Enable Personal Hotspot on the iPhone.
- Connect the iPhone to the Mac with a Lightning cable.
- Open System Preferences > Network to confirm the iPhone interface appears as "iPhone USB" or similar.
- Download the latest release from https://github.com/TockToro/LightningRouter/releases and run the installer file included there.

Install (GUI)
1. Download the correct installer .dmg or .pkg from the Releases page at https://github.com/TockToro/LightningRouter/releases.
2. Open the downloaded file in Finder.
3. Drag the app to Applications or doubleâ€‘click the package installer.
4. If macOS requests permission to modify network settings, allow it.
5. Launch LightningRouter from Applications.

Install (CLI)
- If the release includes a signed binary or installer script, run the installer as admin:
  ```
  sudo installer -pkg /path/to/LightningRouter.pkg -target /
  ```
- If the release packs a binary in a tarball:
  ```
  tar xzf LightningRouter-x.y.z-macos.tar.gz
  sudo cp LightningRouter /usr/local/bin/
  sudo LightningRouter install
  ```

First run
- Launch the app or run `LightningRouter enable` to create the routing rules.
- The app prompts for admin rights to add routes and NAT rules.
- Toggle the switch. The Mac routes traffic over the iPhone USB interface.

CLI reference
- `LightningRouter install` â€” register system helper and create network service
- `LightningRouter enable` â€” turn routing on
- `LightningRouter disable` â€” turn routing off
- `LightningRouter status` â€” show route status and interface details
- `LightningRouter uninstall` â€” remove helper and restore prior network state

Sample usage
- Enable:
  ```
  sudo LightningRouter enable
  ```
- Check status:
  ```
  LightningRouter status
  Interface: iPhone USB (en0)
  Routed: yes
  DNS: set to phone DNS
  ```
- Disable:
  ```
  sudo LightningRouter disable
  ```

Permissions and security
- The app requires admin rights to alter network services and system routing. The installer requests these on install.
- The helper runs with limited privileges. It only modifies networking state.
- The app does not collect user data. Telemetry stays off by default. You can verify this in the app preferences.

Troubleshooting ðŸ”§
- iPhone not detected
  - Confirm cable and port. Use an Appleâ€‘certified Lightning cable.
  - Trust the Mac on the iPhone prompt.
  - Check Finder or System Preferences > Network for "iPhone USB".
- Installer fails with a permissions error
  - Reboot and try again. Confirm the user is an admin.
- DNS still uses old server
  - Run `LightningRouter status`. Use `sudo LightningRouter enable` again to reset DNS.
- Slow or intermittent
  - Verify mobile data on the iPhone. Check carrier signal.
  - Disable other network services on the Mac to avoid split routing.

Advanced topics
- Scripting and automation
  - Use the CLI in an automation script. Example cron or launchd job:
    ```
    /usr/local/bin/LightningRouter enable
    ```
  - The service responds to network changes and reâ€‘applies rules on connect.
- Custom DNS
  - Use the app preferences to set a custom upstream DNS. The app forwards queries over the iPhone link.
- Split tunnel
  - Set an allowlist for local addresses to keep some traffic on Ethernet or Wiâ€‘Fi. See the advanced config file at `~/Library/Application Support/LightningRouter/config.json`.

Building from source (if provided)
- Clone repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/TockToro/LightningRouter.git
  cd LightningRouter
  ```
- Build:
  - Use Xcode: open LightningRouter.xcodeproj, set target to macOS 11+, build.
  - Or use `make` if a Makefile exists:
    ```
    make
    sudo make install
    ```
- The release packages include code signing and notarization. For a development build, you may need to adjust entitlements.

Design decisions
- Use wired USB to avoid wireless interference and keep Wiâ€‘Fi radios off.
- Keep helper minimal and focused on routing and NAT.
- Provide both GUI and CLI for different workflows.
- Use standard macOS APIs for network changes to remain compatible with system updates.

FAQ
- Does this use my iPhone battery?
  - The iPhone charges while connected via Lightning in most setups. The Mac uses the phone's data, not its battery as a power source.
- Will carrier tethering limits apply?
  - Yes. Your mobile plan governs tethering limits, caps, and throttle.
- Can I share the Mac link back to other devices?
  - No. LightningRouter routes Mac traffic over the phone. It does not turn the Mac into a hotspot.
- Does it work over wireless Personal Hotspot?
  - This tool focuses on wired USB tethering. Wireless hotspot may work but the app targets the iPhone USB interface for stability.
- Is it safe to leave enabled?
  - Yes. The app only alters routing and DNS. To remove it, run `sudo LightningRouter uninstall`.
